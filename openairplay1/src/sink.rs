//! The seam between the AirPlay session and the host's audio output.
//!
//! The library owns network → PCM (RTSP handshake, decrypt, jitter buffer,
//! clock model, decode, prebuffer and the latency-correct start); the host
//! owns PCM → speaker. A host provides an [`AudioSink`] and the library's
//! playback thread feeds it interleaved `i16` samples that should actually
//! play — PCM is held in the prebuffer until release and the start instant,
//! and a FLUSH resets the prebuffer before calling [`AudioSink::flush`].
